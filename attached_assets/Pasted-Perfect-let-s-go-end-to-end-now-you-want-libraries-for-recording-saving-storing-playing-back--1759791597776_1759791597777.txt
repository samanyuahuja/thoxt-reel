Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs go end-to-end now:
you want libraries for recording ‚Üí saving/storing ‚Üí playing back the video.
Here‚Äôs a full, modern breakdown for each stage üëá

‚∏ª

üé• 1. Recording Video (Frontend)

‚úÖ Best Libraries

Library	Use Case	Notes
MediaRecorder API (built-in)	Base browser API to record webcam/screen	No dependency, modern browsers only
react-media-recorder	React wrapper around MediaRecorder	Simplifies start/stop/pause/preview
RecordRTC	All-in-one library for webcam, screen, mic	More control & fallback for older browsers
WebRTC + socket.io	For live-stream or multi-person recording	Use if you want ‚Äúlive‚Äù style recording

Example (React Media Recorder):

import { useReactMediaRecorder } from "react-media-recorder";

const { startRecording, stopRecording, mediaBlobUrl } = useReactMediaRecorder({ video: true, audio: true });

This gives you a recorded Blob ‚Üí can be saved locally or uploaded.

‚∏ª

üíæ 2. Saving / Uploading / Storing Video

You have 3 main storage paths:
(A) Cloud Storage (S3, Firebase, etc.)
(B) Video Hosting APIs (Mux, Cloudflare Stream, etc.)
(C) Local/Server File System (not ideal for scale)

üß∞ Libraries by Platform

Platform	Library	Description
AWS S3	boto3 (Python) / aws-sdk (Node.js)	Upload directly from backend or via presigned URLs
Firebase Storage	firebase/storage	Easiest for web apps; handles auth + CDN
Cloudflare R2	aws-sdk compatible	Cheap S3 alternative
Google Cloud Storage	@google-cloud/storage	Simple API + global CDN
Supabase Storage	@supabase/storage-js	Good for full-stack JS apps
Mux Video API	@mux/mux-node / @mux/mux-player-react	Handles transcoding + playback + storage
Cloudinary	cloudinary npm SDK	Automatically compresses + delivers via CDN

üí° Example Upload Flow (React + FastAPI + S3)

Frontend:

const blob = recordedBlob;
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("video", blob, "recording.webm");
await fetch("/upload", { method: "POST", body: formData });

Backend (Python FastAPI):

import boto3
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile

s3 = boto3.client("s3")

@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_video(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    s3.upload_fileobj(file.file, "my-bucket", file.filename)
    return {"url": f"https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/{file.filename}"}

‚ñ∂Ô∏è 3. Playback / Viewing

‚úÖ Frontend Video Player Libraries

Library	Description	Pros
Video.js	Open-source HTML5 video player	Skins, plugins, captions
React Player	Lightweight React component	Plays YouTube, Vimeo, MP4, HLS
HLS.js	Streams .m3u8 (adaptive bitrate)	Works with HLS/CDN streams
Mux Player	For Mux-hosted videos	Auto quality + analytics
Plyr.js	Clean, customizable player	Works with HTML5 and YouTube/Vimeo

Example (React Player):

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

<ReactPlayer
  url="https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/recording.webm"
  controls
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
/>

üß© 4. Recommended Stack by Complexity

üü¢ Simple Project (Portfolio / Student Demo)
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: React + react-media-recorder
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Flask or Express
	‚Ä¢	Storage: Firebase Storage
	‚Ä¢	Playback: React Player

üü° Intermediate (Custom Dashboard, Video Messaging)
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Next.js + RecordRTC
	‚Ä¢	Backend: FastAPI + AWS S3
	‚Ä¢	Processing: FFmpeg (server or Lambda)
	‚Ä¢	Playback: Video.js + HLS.js

üîµ Advanced / Production (Loom / Streamyard-style)
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: React + WebRTC + FFmpeg.wasm
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Node.js + Mux or Cloudflare Stream API
	‚Ä¢	Storage: Mux / R2 / S3
	‚Ä¢	Playback: Mux Player or HLS.js with adaptive streaming

Would you like me to show a ready architecture diagram + example folder structure for this kind of video recording platform (say ‚ÄúLoom-style‚Äù)?
It‚Äôll show exactly how frontend, backend, and storage talk to each other.
