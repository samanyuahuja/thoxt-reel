The application runs as a Python Flask backend with a vanilla JavaScript frontend, ensuring fast performance and easy deployment within the existing Thoxt infrastructure.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Infrastructure

**app.py** - The core Flask application server that handles all backend operations. This file contains API routes for reel management, script generation, and database operations. It serves HTML templates using Jinja2 and manages CORS policies for cross-origin requests. The server runs on port 5000 and includes routes for:
- Creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting video reels
- AI script generation with OpenAI integration
- View and like tracking for engagement metrics
- Static file serving for CSS, JavaScript, and media assets

**reels.db** - SQLite database file storing all application data including reel metadata, user information, engagement statistics, and timestamps. The schema includes tables for reels with fields like id, title, duration, thumbnail paths, view counts, and creation timestamps.

### Frontend Structure

**templates/base.html** - The master template that defines the common layout structure for all pages. Contains meta tags for mobile optimization, viewport settings, and links to stylesheets. All other HTML templates extend this base to maintain consistent navigation and styling across the application.

**templates/index.html** - The landing page and options menu that serves as the main navigation hub. Features card-based navigation to key sections: My Reels, Create New Reel, and AI Teleprompter. Includes professional styling with gradient borders and touch-optimized buttons for mobile devices.

**templates/recorder.html** - The primary recording interface featuring portrait camera support, Instagram-style vertical sidebar, and teleprompter overlay. This page handles video capture using MediaRecorder API, manages camera permissions, and coordinates between various recording modes including mirror effects and filter applications. The sidebar includes five sections: TEXT (custom overlays), STICKER (emoji elements), FILTER (Instagram-quality effects), MUSIC (audio tracks), and MIRROR (flip mode).

**templates/ai-script.html** - The AI-powered script generation interface where users input topics, select video duration (15/30/60 seconds), and choose tone (engaging, professional, casual, educational). Integrates with OpenAI API to generate optimized video scripts that are stored in sessionStorage and transferred to the teleprompter.

**templates/saved-reels.html** - Gallery view displaying all recorded reels with playback controls, metadata display, and edit/delete options. Features responsive grid layout, thumbnail previews, and duration indicators. Provides navigation to the advanced editor for post-production enhancements.

**templates/editor.html** - Professional video editing interface with advanced tools including filter application with before/after comparison, text overlay system with custom fonts and animations, music library integration, sticker placement, drawing tools, and AI-powered transcript generation capabilities. Uses dual-layer video system for real-time preview of edits.

### JavaScript Modules

**static/js/recorder.js** - Handles all recording functionality including camera initialization with portrait constraints (1080x1920), MediaRecorder setup, canvas-based recording for filters and mirror effects, overlay management, and teleprompter word highlighting. Contains critical functions:
- `initCamera()`: Requests camera access with portrait orientation
- `startRecording()`: Initiates video capture with selected effects
- `stopRecording()`: Finalizes recording and saves to IndexedDB
- `prepareTeleprompter()`: Splits script into highlightable word spans
- `startTeleprompterHighlight()`: Implements 150 words-per-minute highlighting

**static/js/ai-script.js** - Manages AI script generation workflow by collecting user inputs, making API calls to backend endpoints, displaying generated scripts, and handling the transfer of scripts to the teleprompter via sessionStorage.

**static/js/saved-reels.js** - Controls the saved reels gallery, manages IndexedDB operations for video blob retrieval, handles reel playback, and coordinates deletion operations with proper database cleanup.

**static/js/editor.js** - Powers the advanced editing interface with filter preview systems, text overlay positioning, music synchronization, and export functionality.

### Styling System

**static/css/style.css** - Comprehensive stylesheet defining the dark theme aesthetic with yellow accent colors. Contains media queries for responsive design, custom animations for UI elements, Instagram-style filter definitions, teleprompter styling with enhanced readability (large fonts, high line-height), and mobile-optimized layouts. Key sections include:
- Global theme variables and reset styles
- Portrait camera and video container styles
- Sidebar and panel animations
- Filter effect definitions (Valencia, Nashville, Toaster, etc.)
- Teleprompter overlay with word highlighting styles
- Mobile breakpoints for devices under 768px width

## How the System Works

The workflow begins when a user accesses the platform and chooses to create content. For AI-assisted creation, they navigate to the AI Script Generator where they define their video parameters. The system sends a request to the Flask backend, which communicates with OpenAI's API using the stored API key. The generated script is returned, displayed, and made available for teleprompter use.

When recording begins, the application requests camera access with specific portrait constraints. The MediaRecorder API captures video while the canvas system optionally applies real-time effects like mirror transforms and color filters. If the teleprompter is active, words highlight sequentially at a reading-friendly pace, scrolling automatically to keep the current word visible.

Recorded videos are stored locally in IndexedDB as binary blobs with associated metadata saved to the SQLite database. Users can review their reels in the gallery, where clicking edit opens the advanced editor. The editor loads the video blob and provides professional tools for enhancement. Final videos can be downloaded or exported directly to social media platforms.

The entire system is optimized for mobile devices with touch controls, gesture navigation, and responsive layouts that adapt from desktop monitors to smartphone screens. Portrait orientation is enforced for Instagram-compatible output, and all features work seamlessly across device types.

## Troubleshooting

**Camera not working:**
- Ensure browser has camera permissions
- Try HTTPS connection (required for camera access)
- Check if another app is using the camera

**AI Script Generator errors:**
- Verify OpenAI API key is set correctly
- Check API key has sufficient credits
- Ensure internet connection is active

**Videos not saving:**
- Check browser supports IndexedDB
- Ensure sufficient storage space
- Try clearing browser cache

**Port 5000 already in use:**
- Change PORT in .env file to another port (e.g., 8000)
- Or stop other applications using port 5000

## Future Development

The platform is designed for extensibility with planned features including cloud storage integration, collaborative editing, advanced AI capabilities for auto-captioning and scene detection, and direct social media API integration for one-click publishing. The modular architecture ensures that new features can be added without disrupting existing functionality.
